  This fullstack MERN application hosts a forum for posting and reacting to users' thoughts. In addition to MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js, this application also uses React Router to give this single page application the look and feel of a multi-page one, and it utilizes Apollo and GraphQL to make requests and cache files. Users are able to create and log into their own accounts, post thoughts, react to thoughts, and add friends.
